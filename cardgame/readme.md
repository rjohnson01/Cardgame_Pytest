- Roger Johnson

# Requirements
- Here is your first task: Choose 5 critical features of your battle game logic. Write one unit test (one function with one assert) for each of these features. 
- You will use Pytest. https://docs.pytest.org/en/3.0.0/getting-started.html
- When I say “choose 5 features”, think of each feature as a single test case against an acceptance criterion
- The tests will reside in a “tests” directory, on the root level of your battle game repository
- I should be able to run these tests by simply typing “pytest” and hitting enter
